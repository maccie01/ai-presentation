# Project Brief: AI Presentation Website

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive website presentation in the Porsche Design System (PDS) with a dynamic Silicon Valley aesthetic. The target audience is an Information Security department. The presentation will cover various aspects of AI, focusing on practical applications, best practices, and specialized knowledge relevant to the automotive industry and information security.

## Core Objectives
1. Create a visually impressive and interactive presentation using PDS guidelines
2. Present comprehensive information about AI in a structured, chronological format
3. Include interactive elements for hands-on learning and demonstration
4. Ensure the presentation is informative and valuable specifically for an Information Security audience
5. Incorporate automotive industry-specific examples and use cases

## Technical Requirements
- Next.js framework with TypeScript
- Porsche Design System (PDS) integration
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Interactive components including code editors and live demos
- Smooth animations and transitions between sections
- High performance and accessibility standards

## Content Structure
The presentation consists of eight main sections, each with specific subtopics:

1. **KI-Ãœberblick**: AI introduction, current products, and 2025 trends
2. **High-Level Prompting**: Prompt architecture, patterns, best practices, tools, examples, and interactive demos
3. **Kontextwahl**: Methods for integrating company data, dynamic templates, and security practices
4. **Memory-Prompts und /memory bank**: Concepts of memory in LLMs, implementation, and practical demonstrations
5. **Branchen-spezifische Automotive-Beispiele**: Industry-specific use cases with examples
6. **Microsoft Office KI-Produkte**: Integration of AI in Microsoft products, especially Power Platform components for information security applications
7. **MCP-Server**: Architecture, functionality, and demonstrations of Model Context Protocol servers
8. **Ausblick & Trends**: Future directions, security roadmap, and governance recommendations

## Design Guidelines
- Follow PDS standards from the Figma Library
- Use typographic hierarchies and bold color gradients
- Incorporate generous white space
- Implement animated transitions
- Each section should have a hero element
- Include interactive code editors for live experimentation

## Success Criteria
- Visually appealing presentation that follows PDS guidelines
- Comprehensive coverage of all specified content areas
- Functional interactive elements that enhance learning
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Clear navigation and intuitive user experience
