## Notes

The project is progressing according to schedule. The Power Platform section has been updated to focus on general capabilities of each component rather than security-specific applications. We've implemented an interactive Power Apps canvas creator to demonstrate the low-code app development experience, and the Power Platform ecosystem overview has been updated to include all major components including Power Apps and Dataverse.

Each section builds upon the previous ones, demonstrating increasingly complex AI applications and integration scenarios.
