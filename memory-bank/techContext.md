│   ├── ui/                # Basic UI components
│   └── providers/         # Context providers and wrappers
├── lib/                   # Utility functions and helpers

├── styles/                # Global styles and theme configuration
└── types/                 # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Component Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture:

1. **Layout Components**: Provide the structural foundation
   - MainLayout: Main container with header, navigation, content area, and footer
   - Header: Top navigation and branding
   - NavigationBar: Section navigation with progress tracking
   - Footer: Bottom navigation and metadata

2. **Section Components**: Reusable templates for content sections
   - SectionHero: Hero area with title and introduction
   - SectionContent: Main content container with typography
   - InteractiveArea: Container for interactive elements
   - SectionSummary: Summary and next section navigation

3. **Interactive Components**: For user engagement and learning
   - CodeEditor: Monaco-based code editor with syntax highlighting
   - CodeEditorWithTabs: Multi-file code editor with tab switching
   - PromptBuilder: Interactive prompt creation and visualization
   - FlowDiagram: Interactive flow diagram using React Flow
   - ChartVisualization: Data visualization using D3.js
   - MermaidDiagram: Diagram rendering using Mermaid.js

4. **UI Components**: Basic building blocks for the interface
   - Custom wrappers around PDS components
   - Enhanced with additional functionality when needed

### Data Flow
- **Static Content**: Stored directly in component files
- **Interactive State**: Managed with React hooks (useState, useReducer)
- **Navigation State**: Handled by Next.js App Router
- **Visualization Data**: Passed as props to diagram components

## Development Environment

### Setup Requirements
- Node.js 18+ for development
- npm or yarn for package management
- Modern browser with developer tools for testing

### Development Workflow
1. Start development server with turbopack: `npm run dev`
2. Components are developed in isolation using a component-first approach
3. Integration into sections after component functionality is verified
4. Continuous testing across device sizes using responsive design tools

### Build and Deployment
- Production build is created with `npm run build`
- Static export is possible for simple hosting
- Alternatively, Next.js deployment platforms can be used

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Considerations
- Complex visualizations need optimization for smooth rendering
- Interactive components should be lazy-loaded when possible
- Animation performance needs to be monitored and optimized
- Mobile performance requires special attention for complex diagrams

### Accessibility Requirements
- All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable
- Proper ARIA attributes required for complex UI components
- Visualizations need alternative text or descriptions
- Color contrast must meet WCAG standards

### Browser Compatibility
- Focus on modern evergreen browsers
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Special attention to mobile browser quirks
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Dependencies Management

### Library Usage Strategy
- Use PDS components as the primary UI building blocks
- Extend with custom components when PDS doesn't offer needed functionality
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies by leveraging built-in React and Next.js capabilities
- Use specialized libraries only for complex features (visualizations, code editing)

## Integration Points

### Porsche Design System Integration
- Using @porsche-design-system/components-react for UI components
- Custom theme configuration to match PDS guidelines
- Extended with custom components when needed

### Visualization Libraries
- React Flow for node-based interactive diagrams
- D3.js for data visualizations and charts
- Mermaid.js for flow diagrams and sequence diagrams

### Code Editor Integration
- Monaco Editor for code editing and demonstration
- React Syntax Highlighter for static code display

## Technical Challenges

### Current Implementation Challenges
- Performance optimization for complex visualizations
- Smooth animations across different components
- Consistent responsive behavior for interactive elements
- Effective state management for complex interactive demos

### Ongoing Technical Focus
- Improving animation performance and consistency
- Enhancing accessibility features across all components
- Optimizing mobile experience for complex visualizations
- Ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers

## Future Technical Considerations
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Server components optimization for improved performance
- Advanced animation techniques for smoother transitions
- Potential integration with backend services for more complex demos
