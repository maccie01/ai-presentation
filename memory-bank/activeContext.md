# Active Context

## Current Focus

**Testing & Deployment Phase**

After completing the Ausblick & Trends section with visualizations for trends forecasting, security roadmap, and governance recommendations, we are now moving to the Testing & Deployment phase.

This phase will focus on ensuring all components are working correctly, the application is responsive across different devices, and it adheres to Porsche Design System guidelines before final deployment.

## Recent Changes

- Completed the Ausblick & Trends section with:
  - TrendsForecast component with technology adoption curves, capability evolution timeline, and impact assessment matrix
  - SecurityRoadmap component with security challenge/solution mapping and risk evolution visualization
  - GovernanceChecklist component with governance framework diagram, compliance assessment, and RACI matrix
- Fixed various linter errors across components
- Completed the MCP-Server section with:
  - ArchitectureDiagram component visualizing the MCP server components and request/response flow
  - ConnectorExample component showing handshake process, discovery mechanism, and invocation sequence
  - JsonPayloadDemo component with interactive examples of JSON payloads
- Completed Power Platform section with all requested components
- Updated todo.md to reflect current project status

## Next Steps

1. Continue developing the Microsoft Office KI section according to todo.md
   - Implement Power Automate workflow builder
   - Create Power BI dashboard designer
   - Develop Power Pages site builder
   - Implement Copilot Studio bot builder
   - Create integration example showcases
2. Improve animation system for smoother transitions
3. Enhance accessibility for interactive components
4. Optimize performance for complex visualizations
5. Ensure responsive behavior across all device sizes
6. Add proper error handling for interactive components
7. Fix rendering issues with some Mermaid diagrams

## Active Decisions

- Following the same component structure as previous sections
- Using a consistent design language across all sections
- Implementing interactive examples where possible
- **Next.js with App Router**: Successfully implemented as the core framework
- **TypeScript**: All components are using TypeScript with proper typing
- **Porsche Design System (PDS)**: Integrated for consistent design with custom components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for custom styling and responsive layouts
- **Framer Motion**: Integrated for animations and transitions
- **Monaco Editor**: Implemented for interactive code editor components
- **React Flow/D3.js**: Implemented for data visualization components
- **Mermaid.js**: Implemented for flow diagrams and sequence diagrams
- **Custom PDS Components**: Extended with PIcon for consistent iconography

## Current Requirements and Goals

- Create clear examples of AI integration with Microsoft Office tools
- Demonstrate practical applications for business users
- Highlight low-code development capabilities
- Connect examples to previous sections where relevant
